# Security Policy

This document outlines security policy and procedures for this project.

## Reporting a potential security vulnerability

We have multiple avenues to receive security-related vulnerability reports.

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities by:

+ Submitting a [bug](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/cs-azure-integration-bicep/issues/new/)
+ Submitting a [pull request](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/cs-azure-integration-bicep/pulls) to potentially resolve the issue
+ Sending an email to __oss-security@crowdstrike.com__

## Disclosure and mitigation process

Upon receiving a security bug report, the issue will be assigned to one of the project maintainers. This person will coordinate the related fix and release
process, involving the following steps:

+ Communicate with you to confirm we have received the report and provide you with a status update.
  + You should receive this message within 48-72 business hours.
+ Confirmation of the issue and a determination of affected versions.
+ An audit of the codebase to find any potentially similar problems.
+ Preparation of patches for all releases still under maintenance.
  + These patches will be submitted as a separate pull request and contain a version update.
  + This pull request will be flagged as a security fix.
  + Once merged, and after post-merge unit testing has been completed, the patch will be immediately published to both PyPI repositories.

## Comments

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved, please let us know by [summarizing your thoughts in an issue](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/cs-azure-integration-bicep/issues/new/).
